# Unveiling Obesity dynamics in Allegheny county- A Comprehensive Statistical Analysis of Health and Environmental Factors
This project is a part of the Capstone presentation for the MS in Applied Statistics graduate program at Columbia University.

#### -- Project Status: Completed

## Project Description

This cross-sectional study examined the prevalence of obesity in Allegheny County by analyzing health conditions, environmental factors, and lifestyle choices including medication usage, drinking habits, and air quality, with methods including linear regression, clustering, random forest, and regression tree for understanding linear and non-linear predictors. My findings indicated that these factors significantly influence obesity prevalence, highlighting the complex and substantial role of lifestyle and environmental conditions in obesity prevalence. I investigated socio-economic and demographic influences using regression and classification techniques. 
I analyzed connections between obesity diagnosis, limited economic opportunities, and demographic factors. I emphasized the impact of housing crisis, low family income, and lack of health insurance, integrated insights into physical health and explored links with diabetes, heart diseases, and healthy habits. I leveraged machine learning classification methods for a nuanced understanding of demographic influences on obesity prevalence in county level phenomena. The data for this study was sourced from the Allegheny County Community Indicators section on the Allegheny County official website, a reliable and comprehensive source for health-related statistics in the region, this open-source covered 387 census tracts, the dataset provided a granular view of health metrics across Allegheny County. The temporal range of the data varies, with each health metric corresponding to a specific year between 2011 and 2018. All were expressed as percentage rates for each census tract. 12 variables included in this study have been meticulously chosen for their relevance and potential impact on understanding the health dynamics of obesity.
