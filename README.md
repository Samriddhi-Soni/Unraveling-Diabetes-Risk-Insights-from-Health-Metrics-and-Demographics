# Unveiling Obesity dynamics in Allegheny county- A Comprehensive Statistical Analysis of Health and Environmental Factors
This project is a part of the Capstone presentation for the MS in Applied Statistics graduate program at Columbia University.

#### -- Project Status: Completed

## Project Description

This cross-sectional study examines the prevalence of obesity in Allegheny County by analyzing health conditions, environmental factors, and lifestyle choices including medication usage, drinking habits, and air quality, with methods including linear regression, heatmap clustering, random forest, and regression tree. Our findings indicate that these factors
significantly influence diabetes prevalence, highlighting the complex and substantial role of lifestyle and environmental conditions in diabetes prevalence.Investigating Socio-Economic and Demographic Influences using Classification Techniques. Analyzing connections between obesity diagnosis, limited economic opportunities, and demographic factors. Emphasizing the impact of housing crisis, low family income, and lack of health insurance. Integrating insights into physical health, exploring links with diabetes, heart diseases, and health habits. Leveraging machine learning classification methods for a nuanced understanding of demographic influences on obesity prevalence.
